[REVENGE] That pummelling really took a lot out of me...I think I deserve a break!
[REVENGE] Sitting down at the park and appreciating the radical greenery...a perfect way to spend the afternoon!
[PIGEON] Coo!
[NARRATOR] <Splat!>
[REVENGE] What the-?! Eugh! Stupid bird! How dare you use me as your personal lavatory!
[REVENGE] Take me to your infernal master, airborne rat!
[PIGEON] Uoo-oo-oo!
[OLD MAN] Eh? Hello sonny, do you want to feed the pigeons with me?
[REVENGE] It's you who's responsible for ruining my shirt!
[REVENGE] Prepare to be eviscerated into the next life along with your stupid birds, senior citizen!
[OLD MAN] Why that's quite uncalled for! Someone ought to teach you some manners!
