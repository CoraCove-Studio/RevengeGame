[NARRATOR] - It's a peaceful day out in the city... -
[NARRATOR] - For once, our violent protagonist is enjoying the quiet. -
[REVENGE] You know, I think I might just give up revenge. I have a job, hobbies...
[REVENGE] And my beloved plant, "FATAL CARNAGE."
[REVENGE] Life might just be looking up for me!
[TV] <BZZT!> We are live now, about to see the President for the first time ever go to the moon! <BZZT!>
[REVENGE] Huh?
[TV] <BZZT!> The rocket will be taking off in 3...2... <BZZT!>
[NARRATOR] <BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR>
["Fatal Carnage" the Plant] <CRASH!>
[REVENGE] GASP! My plant!
[REVENGE] Stay calm...it can be fixed...
[REVENGE] ...
[REVENGE] Screw that! The President's going to talk to my fists for destroying my beloved plant!
[REVENGE] The moon isn't that far away...I'll just hitch a ride on the rocket and turn his face into mashed potatoes when we get there!
[REVENGE] I will avenge "Fatal Carnage" the Plant!
